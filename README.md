CampbellSoup
============
CampbellSoup, the web-based archive of Campbell test questions.

Configuration
-------------
The CampbellSoup application requires you to pass a `Configuration` object at app creation time that provides a small number of configuration values. Refer to `run.py` for an example and further documentation.

Running
-------
You are advised to run CampbellSoup as a WSGI application from your favourite HTTP server.
For debugging purposes, CampbellSoup can also be run from the command line using `run.py` (this will start a server on port `5000`). _Don't even think of using `run.py` for production!_
